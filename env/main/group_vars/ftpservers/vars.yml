  This FTP server allows users to upload large data to the Galaxy server at:

    https://usegalaxy.org/

  Your login uses the same credentials as your Galaxy login - email address and
  password.

  Once files are successfully uploaded, the list of files available for importing
  in to a history will be displayed in the regular Upload tool.  For assistance,
  please contact:

    galaxy-bugs@galaxyproject.org

  Files uploaded via FTP and not imported to a history within three days will be
  deleted.
