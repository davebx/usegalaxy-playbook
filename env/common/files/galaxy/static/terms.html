        <h1>Galaxy Web Portal Service Agreement</h1>

        <p>
        1) Use of Service. The Galaxy Web Portal is a free, public, Internet accessible resource (the "Service"). Data transfer and data storage are not encrypted. If there are restrictions on the way your research data can be stored and used, please consult your local institutional review board or the project principal investigator before uploading it to any public site, including this Service. If you have protected data, large data storage requirements, or short deadlines you are encouraged to set up your own local Galaxy instance and not use this Service. Your access to the service may be revoked at any time for reasons deemed necessary by the operators of the Service.
        </p>

        <p>
        2) Accounts and Service Limitations. You may choose to register an account with the Service. Your registration data is primarily used so you may persistently store data on the Service and use advanced Galaxy features such as sharing and workflows. The operators of the Service will not provide your registration data to any third party unless required to do so by law. Your access to the Service is provided under the condition that you abide by any published quotas on data storage, job submissions, or any other limitations placed on the public Service. Attempts to subvert these limits by creating multiple accounts or through any other method may result in termination of all associated accounts.
        </p>

        <p>
        3) Disclaimer. The Service is provided to you on an "AS IS" BASIS and WITHOUT WARRANTY, either express or implied, including, without limitation, the warranties of non-infringement, merchantability or fitness for a particular purpose. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY OF THE SERVICE IS WITH YOU. This DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY constitutes an essential part of this service agreement.
        </p>

        <p>
        4) Limitation of Liability. Under no circumstances and under no legal theory, whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise, shall The Pennsylvania State University or any other entity which provides resources for the Service be liable to anyone for any indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a result of the use of this Service including, without limitation, damages for loss of goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all other commercial damages or losses. This limitation of liability shall not apply to the extent applicable law prohibits such limitation.
